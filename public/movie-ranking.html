<h2>My recent Top movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dune Part 1 and Part 2</h3>
<p>
  I watched the part 1 of this movie back in 2023 if i can recall clearly. It
  was so captivating and intriguing. The sound effects were crazy. I watched the
  part 2 in cinemas and the audio and visuals were crazy. totally recommend it.
</p>
<h3>Rebel Moon 1 an 2</h3>
<p>
  Just like Dune, the visuals are crazy. Zack Snyder remains my favorite movie
  director. His movies are mindblowing, His imaginative and constructiveness in
  scripts and stories should be a world treasure. He is THE MAN literally.
</p>
<h3>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</h3>
<p>
  Can't believe i just saw this movie. the visuals be giving 2023 not 2017. way
  ahead of its time for real
</p>
<h3>The Beekeeper</h3>
<p>
  Once Jason Statham is in a movie, forget it. IT IS DONE MATE! no pun intended.
</p>
<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>It was action packed honestly</p>
<h3>Argyelle</h3>
<p>
  I am not sure i spelt that correctly but just like Bullet Train, Action Packed
</p>
<h3>Clash of the Titans</h3>
<p>
  BROOOOO!!!! I just had to watch this movie again! The visuals are crazy damn!
  wish i watched it on cinemas Ultra HD
</p>
<h3>Wrath of the Titans</h3>
<p>
  I don't know why this movie series doesn't have a sequel! I may not like the
  worship of gods but the visuals in this movie series are crazy damn!
</p>
<h3>Extraction 1 and 2</h3>
<p>
  Chris Hemsworth flopped the last Thor movie; Love and Thunder or I believe
  Disney flopped the Marvel movie series to promote their woke culture for box
  office gains but it still flopped big time But Extraction. No words. Just like
  Homelander would say "It was perfect, perfect! EVERYTHING, down to the minute
  details mate". Can't wait for THE BOYS Season 4 and an Extraction 3 damn
</p>
<h3>The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die</h3>
<p>
  There is something about medievial movies mate. Damn, it can not be described.
  The Series of this movie was crazy mate!!!!!!!! No words! Game of Thrones and
  The Last Kingdom ughhhhh. one thing I did not like about this movie was that
  it felt rushed, some scenes were not in depth. Maybe because the producers
  felt it would flop but still it was crazy. My favourite phrase Uthred "DESTINY
  IS ALL."
</p>
<h3>The pianist</h3>
<p>
  This movie is so freaking emotional, I do not like being emotional while
  watching movies because of the obvious but bro. The scenes, the actor, the
  visuals. ugh. THE ART OF WAR is one of those HOMO SAPIENS should have never
  learnt or discovered.
</p>
<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>
  Ironically, they are currently in another war. Great movie but MAN never LEARN
</p>
<h3>Napoleon</h3>
<p>
  I anticipated for this movie, very much hyped but still delivered in visuals
  and sound effects
</p>
<h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p>
  I can not rememeber this movie clearly but I watched it and it is Medievial so
  it is definitly good
</p>
<h3>Nowhere</h3>
<p>
  This movie was just too emotional and I was disgusted. extremely graphic
  scenes but damn, it was good no cap
</p>
<h3>The Black Book</h3>
<p>
  Netflix Africa be doing the most now. Most of the Netflix African movies I
  have watched are crazy and the stories deliver. Black Book is definitely one
  of them. Amazon hollywood seems to be way better than that of Netflix and
  Disney. They be delivering a lot of woke contents now. Amazon be keeping it
  real. I hope it remains that way.
</p>
<h3>Oppenehemier</h3>
<p>
  Overhyped for no reason whatsoever. Great visuals and storyline, phenomenal
  sound effects. Mr. Ludwig delivered. Cillian Murphy was lead actor so of
  course! mesmerizing as always.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  Nahh... I think I am done damn. I've watched a lot of movies but these ones I
  could come up with. Quote me on this "Medievial Movies" mate. damnn.
